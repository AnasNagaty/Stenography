# Stenography-

This code demonstrates a simple steganography technique where a message can be hidden within an image's red channel by modifying the least significant bits. The hiding process ensures that the message is terminated and aligned correctly for retrieval. The retrieval process extracts the hidden message by detecting and decoding the termination sequence from the modified image.
